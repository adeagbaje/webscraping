# webscraping

Here is a web scraping project where a basic webpage was scraped to get the quotes and authors.
Requests and Beautifulsoup are the two libraries imported to grab the html page and convert the data from the site.
Various beautifulsoup methods were then used on the soup object.

The output/end result was then saved in a csv file.
